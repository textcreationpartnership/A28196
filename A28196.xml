            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For it is the common Law (through the Å¿undry Writs of prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition which it uÅ¿eth) which keepeth every Court within the compaÅ¿Å¿e of his proper Å¿phere, and upholdeth the juriÅ¿diction of the Court of the Earle MarÅ¿hall.

            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> FirÅ¿t, that the Court of the Lord ConÅ¿table and Earle MarÅ¿hall have had, and now the Earle MarÅ¿hals Court hath particular juriÅ¿diction ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57614:19"/>and primarily to determine matters of controverÅ¿ie concerning Chivalry, Dignity, Honour &amp; Armes, and Å¿ome other things acknowledged to belong to the Å¿aid Court by the Lawes and Statutes of our Countrey.</p>
            <p>Howbeit by a conÅ¿equent but not originally, Å¿ome other Courts of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary juÅ¿tice may, as the caÅ¿e Å¿hall require, determine likewiÅ¿e Å¿uch like controverÅ¿ies touching honour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but not <hi>(eaÅ¿e or in Å¿ua)</hi> but rather by an adjunct, as by this example may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. If there bee two competitiours of a Barony, and during the time that their cauÅ¿e is litigious, the one of them is impleaded at the common Law by originall Writ <hi>Cap. alz &amp; plures</hi> in a perÅ¿onall action, and thereupon an exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent is awarded, whereupon inÅ¿ueth an Outlary, the party outlwaed brings a Writ of errour, and aÅ¿Å¿igneth for er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, that hee having Å¿uch a CaÅ¿tle to him deÅ¿cended, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> holden <hi>per Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam,</hi> whereupon his AnceÅ¿tours have beene Barons, anp he himÅ¿elfe Baron, no Cap. ought to be awarded againÅ¿t him, but in very Å¿peciall caÅ¿es onely,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57614:20"/>therefore the outlary erroneous. This matter of errour alledged, the Court cannot conÅ¿ider without due determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the title of the Barony, wherein if the Court of the Earle MarÅ¿hall Å¿hould adjudged one way by any forraigne Law in the Å¿ame queÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on depending there, and the Court of B.R. adjudge another way by the common law of the Realme: upon this Writ of errour, there would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ue thereof a great confuÅ¿ion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencie in the Common-wealth, which the law will rather eÅ¿chew then any other miÅ¿chiefe whatÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, therefore it doth appeare by the Å¿peeches aforeÅ¿aid, that the common law ought to decide this controverÅ¿ie, and that both Courts ought to follow one and the Å¿ame law, in as much as the common law is more ample then ordinary reports of CaÅ¿es in the yeare bookes.
